            The entrance of any temple in India is picket-fenced by shoe racks. Entering barefoot is a sign of respect and humility, and marks the temple precinct as entirely separate from the thrum and bustle beyond its walls. It’s a tradition that’s similarly observed in Indian homes.

            The camera is an essential on holiday in India. However, while the intricate carvings inside the temple have all the makings of a stunning album, temple etiquette dictates that cameras and mobile phones are verboten. Most temples have a ‘No Photography’ policy, but if in doubt, check with the priest.

            Local dress in India is modest, and even more so in temples. Dress conservatively in trousers or skirts—no shorts—and carry a spare shawl to cover bare shoulders. In Sikh Gurdwaras, including the Golden Temple in Amritsar, both men and women are required to cover their head.

            Stricter temples prohibit leather, including accessories such as belts, wallets and bags, because of the Hindu reverence for cows. Shoes and bags can often be left in the guard of a nearby temple flower seller for a small fee.
